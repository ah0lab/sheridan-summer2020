# GRAPHS
Consists of a finite set of nodes and edges where
1. Each node contains an element
2. Each edge connects two nodes together (even the same node)
    and may contain an edge attribute.
## GRAPH CHARACTERISTICS
*Size*              - The number of nodes in a graph
*Path*              - List of edges such that each node is the 
                        predecessor of the next
*Path Length*       - Number of edges in a path
*Simple Path*       - Each node in the path is distinct
*Cycle*             - A path whose first and last nodes are the same
## GRAPH DIRECTION
*Undirected Graph*  - Consists of unordered edges 
*Directed Graph*    - Conists of ordered edges
## GRAPH CONNECTION QUALITY
*Connected*         - There is a path from every node to every other 
                        node in an undirected Graph.
*Strongly Connected*- There is a path from every node to every other node
*Weakly Connected*  - The underlaying undirected graph is connected
## TREE TYPES
*Free Tree*         - A connected, acyclic, undirected graph
*Rooted Tree*       - A tree with a root
*Weighted Tree*     - A graph with weighted edges (edges are associated with
